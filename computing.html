    <h1>how i do my computing</h1>
      <p>my computing setup always changes so this page may be out of date. if you are curious if this page is up to date, you can <a href="mailto:sys@recai.space">email me</a></h1>
      <h2>my computers</h2>
      <p>
        i daily use my hp elitebook 840 g3 which has artix linux with openrc on it.<br>
        it has 8g ram, 240gb sata ssd and intel i5-6300u.<br><br>
        i also have a beefy ryzen 5 2600x, rtx 2060 oc and 16g ram desktop and use it for llms or just to play games with my friends.<br>
      </p>
    <h2>my operating system choices</h2>
      <p>
        i daily drive artix not because i say everything is bloat or against systemd because its against unix philosophy, i just want to try different init systems.<br>
        i have windows on my desktop but unsloth doesnt work well so i dualboot windows with linux<br>
        i dualboot a debian-based distro</bt>
      </p>
    <h2>what i have on my computers</h2>
    <p>
      i use xfce4 without a display manager and start it via xinit on artix linux.<br>
      i have 5 vms on my desktop and use 2 of them on daily basis<br>
